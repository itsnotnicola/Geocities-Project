                Knitting and crochet are timeless hobbies that have allowed crafters to express themselves, relieve stress, and create art for centuries. 
                Although the two hobbies are very different, they are both forms of fibre art which utlise yarn and fibres such as wool, cotton, bamboo, mohair, acrylic and various other fibres. 
                Whether you’re a seasoned crafter or beginner, knitting and crochet and the communities that surround them hold something for everyone.

                <h3>There are generally two categories of knitting or crochet creations:</h3>    
            </div>
            <div class="yarnBullet">
                <dl>
                <dt>Wearables:</dt> 
                <dd>The category of ‘Wearable’ is generally assigned to any kind of clothing item or garment, extending from socks to jumpers, has and various other items.</dd>
                <dt>Non-wearables:</dt> 
                <dd>“Non-wearable” is generally assigned to any item which serves a purpose that doesn’t include being worn. This can include blankets, bags, table runners, toys or decorations and various other items.</dd>
                </dl> 
            </div>
            <p>Discerning between the two categories is important because of the different choices of yarn or fibre for each category depending on the project.</p>
            
            <p>However similar the two hobbies may seem, their similarities are often limited to the yarns and fibres they use and the materials of the tools associated with them. 
            While the two can be combined- for example, using crochet to cast off on a knitting project- they utilise completely different techniques.</p>
            
            <p>Knitting is achieved through the use of two needles, and is defined according to Wikipedia as:</p>
            <p> <dfn> "…a method for production of textile fabrics by interlacing yarn loops with loops of the same or other yarns.”</dfn></p> 
            
            <p> Conversely, crochet is achieved through the use of one hook, and is defined according to Wikipedia as:</p>
            <p><dfn> “…a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials.”</dfn></p>
            
            <p> As you can see, knitting involves interlacing yarn while crochet involves interlocking yarn, although both do involve achieving this through the use of loops made with the yarn of choice.

            <p> Additionally, Wikipedia defines yarn as:</p>
            <p><dfn>“…a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, used in sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, ropemaking, and the production of textiles.”</dfn> </p> 
            
            <p>Knitting and crochet also both involve a variety of benefits for the crafters who undertake them, including the satisfaction of making something with your own hands!</p>
