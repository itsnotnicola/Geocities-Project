    <h2>Crochet</h2>
    <div class="container1">
        <div class="section" id="crochetIntro">
        <p>Crochet utilises one hook to pull loops of yarn through each other to create a fabric of interwoven loops. While this may sound simialr to knitting, crochet stitches are independant and 
            more easily manipulated. Additionally, crochet involves working with only one active stitch at a time, as each stitch is finished before the next one is begun. Some styles of crochet do 
            work with more than one active stitch at a time, however these variations are less widespread than regular crochet. Crochet is often used for lace making, with two examples being filet crochet and Irish crochet.
            The following page explores just some of the aspects of crochet which make crochet so versatile, such as the vareity of stitches, hooks, fibres and yarns, styles, and techniques. </p>

    <div class="section">
        <p>The first known use of the term 'crochet' occured in Europe in the 19th century. Since then different styles and techniques of crochet have emerged from different areas of the world,
            with some of the most popular styles and techniques being:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mosaic Crochet</li>
            <li>Granny Square Crochet</li> 
            <li>Freeform Crochet</li>
            <li>Crocheted lace</li>
            <li>Tunisian Crochet</li>
            <li>Tapestry Crochet</li>
            <li>Amigurumi</li> 
            <li>Filet Crochet</li>
            <li>Corner to Corner (C2C) Crochet</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Unlike knitting styles and techniques which often produce a similar visual and structural result, the different styles and techniques of crochet are often visually different and easily distinguishable.</p>

        <p>This wide vareity of styles and techniques available, which can be combined, is just one of the reasons crochet is so versatile. Now factor in other important aspects such as stitch choice, 
            needle size, needle material, choice of fibre or yarn, yarn weight, and you can crochet just about anything you could think of. Many patterns are also available in the crochet community, as self-drafting patterns can 
            get intimidating for any kind of crocheter.</p>

        <div class="section" id="crochetStitches">
            <p>Most crochet stitches are either variations or combinations of 6 basic crochet stitches:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chain stitch</li>
                <li>Slip stitch</li>
                <li>Single crochet stitch</li>
                <li>Half double crochet stitch</li>
                <li>Double crochet stitch</li>
                <li>Treble crochet stitch</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many of these stitches can be substituted for each other depending on the desired look by the crocheter, as the name of the stitch often refers to the height as well as the style. For example, a 
                standard double crochet it twice the height of a single crochet and a treble crochet is the equivalent height to three single crochets. This also aacounts for 'turning stitches' in flatlay crochet, 
                in which one chain stitch is chained between rows before or after the work is turned to act as the first stitch. For a double crochet flatlay, the turning chain can be two to three chain stitches depending 
                on the desired tension.

       <h2>Similarities and Differences to Knitting...</h2> 
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Casting On and Casting Off</h3>
        <p>Unlike knitting, crochet does not require the crocheter to cast on. Instead, a chain made up of the desired amount of chain stitches serves as the foundation into which the second row of actual stitches is created.
            Although variations such as Tunision crochet do require a cast on method, most popular crochet styles do not. Additionally, crochet does not need to be cast off. This is because each new stitch created is not dependant 
            on the previous stitch, with only one stitch being active at a time in a project at a time.
        </p>
        <h3>Circular Crochet and Knitting</h3>
        <p>Both crochet and knitting have techniques in which a project can be made Ã­n the round', in other words, created as a tube. This techniques has many uses, such as making hats, socks, and other wearable items- but also 
            baskets, bags and other 'non-wearable items'. Each art has it's own version of this technique, and it's a good way to visualise the cinstructive differences between knitting and crochet.</p>
        <p>Knitting in the round, also known as circular knitting, was originally achieved through using a number of double pointed needles at once to create a circle of stitches, passing the stitches from one needle to the other as usual. 
            However, this approach has been updated through the introduction of circular needles- two single pointed needles joined seamlessly by a cable, making the process much smoother and reducing ladders associated with the many needle 
            switches of double point needles. This technique was further improved upon with the invention of the 'magic loop method', although this method is still suseptable to laddering.</p>
        <p>Crochet in the round uses, arguably, a much simpler technique. The foundation change of the project is instead joined beginning to end, using a slip-stitch, to achieve a circle of foundation chains. This foundation circle can then 
            be worked into normally. The only other difference between this technique and flatlay crochet is the method used to start or end a new row, which, in terms of crochet in the round, depends on the crocheters needs of the project. 
            However, the beginning stitch of that row of the round and the end of that row are generally joined through a slip stitch, and then the usual turning stitches are crocheted as usual and the next row in the round is begun. It is also
            very easy to branch off of a project crocheted in the round with flatlay crochet, as the stitches are independant of each other.  </p>
        <h3>The Similar Benefits of Both Crochet and Knitting</h3>
        <p>Both knitting and crochet, as well as various other forms of needlework, are shown to prevent and manage stress, pain and depression, due to the rythmic and repeatative nature of the crafts. Both are also found to change brain chemistry 
            to increase various good hormones and decrease stress hormones.</p>
        <p>Both crafts are aslo linked to decreasing rates of Alzheimer's and Dementia as they decrease memory loss, as well as increasing dexterity in the hands and fingers.</p>
        <p>Not only this, but there is also a big social aspect to these crafts due to the communities that surround them!</p>
