            <p>Knitting utilises two needles, or circular needles, to interlace yarn loops to create fabric. 
            When knitting, there are often many active loops on the needles. These active loops interlace the whole fabric together, 
            and dropping one may result in ladders in the fabric that is being created, or other unintended results. 
            As the knitter uses the needles to form a new loop, this loop will intermesh with the previous loops, forming a fabric.
            The following page explores the various factors that make knitting so versatile, 
            such as the vareity of stitches, needles, fibres and yarns, styles and techniques.</p>

        <p>Different types of knitting developed independantly in many different areas of the world around different times. 
            Due to this, there are many different styles of knitting, with the most prevalent styles (also known as holds) and  techniques being:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continental/German style</li> 
            <li>Norwegian style</li> 
            <li>Russian style</li> 
            <li>English style</li> 
            <li>Portuguese/Greek/Incan/Turkish style</li> 
            <li>Armenian Technique</li> 
            <li>German short row</li> 
            <li>Japanese short row</li> 
        </ul>
        <p> Styles, holds and techniques manily depend on the way the neeldes are held and the manner in which the working yarn is wrapped around the needles to create a new loop. 
            Each of the above styles, holds and techniques utilises a different combiation of the manner in which the working yarn and needles are held and used.</p>
        <p> This wide vareity of styles and techniques available, which can be combined, is just one of the reasons knitting is so versatile. Now factor in other important 
            aspects such as stitch choice, needle size, needle material, choice of fibre, yarn weight, and you can knit just about anything you could think of. While patterns 
            are widespread among the knitting community, free-handing is also possible.

        <div class="section">
            <p>Many different styles of stitches can be acheived while knitting, with the most popular being:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Knit and purl (Known together as Garter stitch, one of the most common stitches used in garment construction and general knitting.)</li> 
                <li>Cable and twist</li> 
                <li>Rib stitch</li> 
                <li>Eyelet and lace</li> 
            </ul>
            <p> 
                There are many other stitches, which can be combined to acheive different variations and styles depending on what is desired. For example, 
                cabling is acheived through combining knit stitches, purl stitches, and rib stitches in order to acheive the intricate effect of a cable. 
                Additionally, different stitches may be selected based on their different properties. For example, the ‘wrong side’ of a knit stitch will always be purl, 
                but the ‘wrong side’ of purl will not always be knit, due to the way the direction of stitches is changed. While this may sound confusing if you’re unfamilar 
                with knitting anything more than a plain purl stitch, simple graphs and charts such as the one depicted here can help!

            <h2>Casting On and Casting Off...</h2>
        </div> 
    <div class="section">
        <p>Casting off and casting on are key aspects of knitting, as no project would be able to begin or end without them. Just like the various styles
            and techniques of knitting, there are various styles and techniques of casting on and casting off.</p>
        <h3>Casting On</h3>
        <p>Casting on refers to the process of adding active stitches onto the needles which do not depend on any previous stitches. It generally
            defines the first edge of a project. </p> 
        <p>The most popular incude:</p>   
        <ul>
            <li>Long-tail cast on</li>
            <li>Provisional cast on</li>
            <li>Crochet chain cast on</li>
            <li>Single cast on</li>
            <li>Knit on cast on</li>
            <li>Tubular cast on (utilised in circular knitting)</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <h3>Casting Off</h3>  
        <p> Casting off, also known as binding off, refers to the process of taking all active stitches off the needles by ending the column of stitches. Casting off
            is generally used to create the final edge of a project, but it can also be used for features such as button holes.</p> 
        <p>The most popular include:</p>   
            <ul>
                <li>Simple cast off</li>
                <li>Knit cast off</li>
                <li>Sewn cast off</li>
                <li>Three needle cast off</li>
                <li>Tubular cast off (utilised in circular knitting)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Just like all aspects of knitting, casting on and casting off are both customisable depending on the effect desired by the knitter.
            Once the first row is cast on, the knitter can continue in any stitch. Alternatively, the last row can be any type of stitch before casting off. 
            Any style and technique of knitting (aside from crcular knitting) can also be used with any style of cast on or cast off. </p>
