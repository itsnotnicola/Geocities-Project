    <h2>Yarn and Fibres</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <p>Fibres can be defined according to Wikipedia as:</p>
        <p><dfn>...a natural or artificial substance that is significantly longer than it is wide, that is 
            often used in the manufacture of other materials.</dfn></p>
        <p>The term fibres collectively refers to the materials used in carfts such as knitting and crochet. 
            The term 'fibre' remains the most comprehensive, as there is almost no limit to the material that 
            can be used in theses crafts- as long as they have the appropriate properties to be used effectively in knitting or crochet. 
            Just some of the materials that can be turned into yarn. </p>
        <p>Yarn is the continuous length of interlocked fibres used in knitting and crochet.</p>
        <p>The choice of yarn for a knitting or crochet project is very important, as their are many different types of yarns, made of 
            different fibres, with different properties. The properties that are desired for a specific knitting or crochet project depend 
            on the crafter, as certain properties are suited for different wearale or non-werable projects, and the intended use for the project.</p>
        <p>Below is just a short list of the most popular and widely used fibres for knitting and crochet.</p>

        <h2>Fibre and Yarn production...</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section"> 
        <p>While the production of yarn and the fibres it is made of does depend on the type of fibre, most yarn is produced in a similar fashion 
            once the fibre has been prepared. Many knitters and crochets choose to spin and dye their own yarn for more control over the specicifc 
            properties of the yarn relative to their project. This enables these crafters to control every aspect of the process and subsequent yarn, 
            such as the yarn weight, colour and gradient, fibre and composion, amount, and so on. Hand dyeing or hand spinning is just another enjoyable aspect of these 
            fibre crafts and art where the possibilites are endless!</p>
        <p>Synethetic and natural fibres can also be combined into one yarn depending on the properties desired. For example, cotton will create a light breathable fabric with 
            a nice drape, and combining it with a percentage of acrylic yarn will make it more durable and affordable, as well as providing a wider choice of colours.</p>
        <p>Many small or local business sell hand dyed, locally produced lots of unique yarns that are often sold in the form of hanks instead of skeins or balls. This is many crafters
            first introduction to the possibilites of small batch yarn, as hanks often then need to be wound by hand, or using a yarn winder with or without a swift, into a yarn cake or skein.
            Yarn winders  are often inexpensive and available at most craft stores, while swifts can be a bit more expensive.
        </p>
        <p>Yarn that is mass produced or has a high composition of synthetic fibres is more likely to be sold as a skein instead of a hank or cake. However, yarn from a skein can also be 
            wound into a cake, as many crafters prefer the centre-pull quality of a cake of yarn as opposed to the other forms.</p>
        <h3>Fibre Production</h3>
        <h4>Plant fibres</h4>
        <p>Natural fibres sourced from plants first need to be harvested from the plant before they can be processed. Once harvested, the fibres then need to be prepared and processed 
            before they can be spun. For home dyeing yarn, yarn should generally be spun first and then dyed, however there are exceptions for this as monochromatic yarn is generally dyed 
            first and then spun.</p>
        <h4>Animal fibres</h4>
        <p>Sourcing natural fibres from animals is arguably a bit more complex due to the nature of raising livestock for the purpose of wool production. Although, the same could be argued 
            for plants. Either way, there are many more factors involved in the production of natural fibres due to the nature of agriculture and the environment.</p>
        <p>Shearing livestock for the purpose of wool production does not harm the animals, and in many cases livestock such as sheep, llamas, and alpacas need to be sheared yearly in order to
            manage and prevent pests and overheating. The wool collected is then spun in a similar manner to natural fibres sourced from plants, however different dyes must be used with different 
            fibres due to their different compositions.</p>
        <h4>Synthetic fibres</h4>
        <p>Synthetic fibres used for spinning yarn are made by shaping long, continuous strands of the material in a gel form. These strands are then stretched, hardened, and cured to make them 
            suitable for spinning into yarn</p>

                <p>As you can see, the choice of fibre depends largely on the nature of the project. Synthetic fibres can be a good choice for projects such as Amigurumi, but should not be chosen 
                    for non-wearables that are exposed to heat such as pot holders. However, it is important to consider the environmental impact of synthetic fibres.</p>
