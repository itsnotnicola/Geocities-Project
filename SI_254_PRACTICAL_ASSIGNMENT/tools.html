<h2>Knitting and Crochet Tools</h2>
<div class="section">
    <p>Knitting and crochet both mainly make use of different kinds of tools, the materials they are made of and the properties of them often overlap. Aside from the main tools of the crafts, knitting 
        needles and the crochet hooks, the rest of the tools used are much the same. This essentially means that scissors or shears are always used to cut yarn and needles are often used for the sewing aspects of 
        both knitting and crochet.</p>
    <p>Although, even these basic yarn-related tools have variations. One could use a yarn needle, a tapestry needle, or even a regular needle for the sewing needs of their craft- or yarn shears, scissors, or embroidery 
        scissors depeding on their preference. The selection of tools for a knitting or crochet project often comes down to the same choice as yarn: <b>what are the needs of the project and what is the preference of the crafter.</b></p>

            <p>Knitting needles and crochet hooks are often made out of the same materials, as these materials have properties which make them effective tools for working with yarn by either crocheting or knitting.</p>
            <p>Modern knitting needles and crochet hooks are often made out of materials such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bamboo</li>
                <li>Aluminum</li>
                <li>Steel</li>
                <li>Wood</li>
                <li>Plastic</li>
                <li>Glass</li>
                <li>Casein</li>
                <li>Carbon Fibre</li>

            <h3>Metal, wood or plastic?</h3>
            <p>The main debate in choosing the material of tools comes down to choosing between metal based tools, wood based tools or plastic based tools. </p>
            <h4>Metal tools...</h4>
            <div class="yarnBullet">
            <p>Metal tools include tools commonly made from aluminum and steel.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Grip and friction</dt>
                <dd>This is useful if you're a crafter who's tension or guage is often too tight due to the friction of wooden needles. Yarn glides a lot more on metal needles due to the slight grain of wooden needles- or if your wooden needles 
                    have slight splinters. However, this glide or lack of friction can be too much for some knitters, who may struggle with stitches sliding off their needles if their tension is too loose.</dd>
                <dt>Strenth</dt>
                <dd>Metal tools do not break as easily as wood or plastic, and can be more durable as they will not snap. However, they can bend. The degree to which they can be bent can influence how the crafter works with them- for example bent 
                    knitting needles might form a fabric differently to straight needles. </dd>
                <dt>Sound</dt>
                <dd>Many metal knitting needles often produce a slight clicking sound while being used, some knitters love the sound and some knitters hate it. Many knitters will therefore opt for wooden needles while knitting in public to not 
                    disturb those around them.</dd>
                <dt>Ergonomics</dt>
                <dd>Ergonomics can be a big factor for crochet hooks, as many crocheters find using a normal straight metal crochet hook painful. While metal crochet hooks are still an inexpensive and reliable option, many crocheters prefer to opt 
                    for metal hooks that have plastic handle coverings for less hand pain while crocheting for extended periods of time. An example of an ergonomic crochet hook is pictured to the left. Ergonomic knitting needles do not really exist 
                    unfortunately, as the shape of the needle can influence the formation of stitches and tension.
                </dd>
                <dt>Points</dt>
                <dd>Although wooden knitting needles can be made much the same as metal needles, many find the point and accuracy of metal needles much sharper. This can be important when using lace needles or knitting projects that require sharp points and great precision.</dd>

<div class="section" id="woodenTools">
    <h4>Wooden Tools...</h4>
    <p>Wooden tools include tools commonly made from general wood such as oak or bamboo.</p>
    <div class="yarnBullet">
        <dl>
            <dt>Grip and friction</dt>
            <dd>Wooden tools have a bit more grip than metal tools due to the friction provided by the grain of the wood, there is also the risk o splintering which can snag on your work. However, some knitters suggest that wooden knitting needles 
                hold the work more lighlty than metal needles and feel better on their hands when knitting for extended periods of time. Wooden needles are often helpful if you're a knitter who's tension or gauge is often too loose, as the slight friction supplied by the wood makes the yarn glide slighlt less as easily as metal needles.</dd>
            <dt>Strength</dt>
            <dd>Many crafters enjoy the light feel of wooden tools compared to metal ones, and many well made wooden tools can be extremely durable. However these tools can still be prone to breaking, snapping, or splintering.</dd>
            <dt>Sound</dt>
            <dd>Wooden knitting needles are much quieter than metal needles.</dd>
            <dt>Ergonomics</dt>
            <dd>Wooden crochet hooks are often carved, which allows for them to be shaped ergonomically much more easily. Many crocheters also prefer the feeling of wood in their hands instead of metal.</dd>
        </dl> 
    </div>
    <h4>Plastic Tools...</h4>
    <p>While plastic tools may seem like the perfect mix of properties of wood and metal, plastic tools are not nearly as popular as wooden or metal tools. However, plastic tools are a good option for beginners due to their inexpensivity and mix of properties. They can be more durable than wooden tools, but they may flex and bend more. This is particularly an issue with plastic crochet hooks.</p>
